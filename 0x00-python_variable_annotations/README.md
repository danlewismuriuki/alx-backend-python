# Type Annotations and Duck Typing in Python

## Project Overview

This project is designed to enhance your understanding of type annotations in Python 3, and how to use them to specify function signatures and variable types. It also explores the concept of duck typing in Python and demonstrates how to validate code using `mypy`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- **Understand Type Annotations**: Explain type annotations in Python 3 and how they help in specifying the expected data types for variables and function signatures.
- **Use Type Annotations**: Apply type annotations to functions and variables to make code more readable and maintainable.
- **Duck Typing**: Understand and apply the concept of duck typing in Python, which allows for flexibility in type checking.
- **Validate Code with `mypy`**: Use `mypy` to check the correctness of your type annotations and ensure that your code adheres to the specified types.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/type-annotations-python.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd type-annotations-python
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install mypy:

bash
Copy code
pip install mypy
Usage
Type Annotations
Type annotations are used to specify the expected types of function arguments and return values. For example:

python
Copy code
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}"
Duck Typing
Duck typing is a concept where the type or class of an object is determined by its behavior (methods and properties) rather than its explicit type. For instance, if an object implements a certain method, it is treated as if it were of that type.

Code Validation with mypy
To validate your code with mypy, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
mypy your_module.py
mypy will check the type annotations in your code and report any type mismatches.

Examples
Example Function with Type Annotations
python
Copy code
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
Example of Duck Typing
python
Copy code
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flies away")

class Airplane:
    def fly(self):
        print("Soars through the sky")

def make_it_fly(flying_thing):
    flying_thing.fly()

bird = Bird()
plane = Airplane()

make_it_fly(bird)
make_it_fly(plane)
Testing
To ensure your code is working correctly with type annotations, run:

bash
Copy code
pytest
Ensure to have your test cases that cover different scenarios and validate type correctness.
